# 👋 Hi, I'm Teemu!

I'm a data-driven problem solver and graduated from **Information Technology BBA (Datatekniikat ja Tekoäly)** from Turku University of Applied Sciences in 10/2025. I enjoy working with data, uncovering insights and creating clear visualizations that help people understand complex information.

I have hands-on experience in **sports analytics**, **business data analysis**, **SQL databases**, **data visualization**, and **Python-based application development**. I like building small tools, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly learning something new.

## 🔨 What i have build?

**StatsBomb data explorer**
- A Streamlit app for exploring StatsBomb open data. You can view Touch heatmaps, key passes, passing stats and match by match performance trends. This project was built to deepen my understanding of sports event data, how actions are recorded, connected and interpreted. I also wanted to improve my data-visualization skills by creating clear, intuitive visuals that make player performance easy to explore and understand.

**Tournament app**
- A Streamlit app for recording and showcasing our friend group’s video game tournaments. We occasionally play FIFA or NHL tournaments, and until now the results have been tracked in Excel. The app now loads all tournament data directly from an Excel file and turns it into a clean, structured, and interactive interface for everyone to browse.
I wanted to create a simple and easy-to-use web app so anyone can check past tournaments whenever they want. More tournaments will be added over time, but the app currently displays only the most recent one.
In this project, I learned more about Streamlit, how to structure cleaner and more user-friendly pages, how to present data neatly and clearly, how to build a custom point-system with specific rules, and how to process spreadsheet-based data into dynamic, real-time visualizations.
